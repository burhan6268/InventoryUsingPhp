                A Marketplace is defined as venue for the retail sales of all products, packed and unpacked where the
                sale is to end users.
                In practice, retail markets are most often associated with the sale of fresh produce,
                including fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and poultry, but may also sell small consumable household goods such as cleaning agents. Globally, different terms may be used to refer to a retail market. For instance, in the Middle East, a market place may be known as a bazaar or souq/souk
